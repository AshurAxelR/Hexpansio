# Happiness

Happiness is calculated _per city_.

Each city starts with **baseline happiness** specified in new game settings (+5 by default).  
[Utopia](improvements.html#city.utopia) upgrade increases this number by +1 each time it is built.

Additional <span style="color:#33ccdd">Happiness</span> can be gained as [income](index.html#income) from tiles and resources.

<span style="color:#f00">Happiness is reduced by:</span>

* **City population.**

	<span class="info">[Highrise](improvements.html#city.highrise) upgrade reduces this factor by 50%.</span>

* **Number of cities.**

	<span class="info">You eventually need to build [Utopia](improvements.html#city.utopia) in every city in order to continue expansion.</span>

* The number of **unemployed workers**.

	<span class="info">Unemployement reduces happiness _quadratically_.</span>

* Each consecutive turn spent in **poverty** (no <span title="Gold" style="color:#ddcc33">&#11044;</span>&thinsp;Gold in treasury).

* **Starvation** (negative <span style="color:#99dd55">Food</span> in the city).

	<span class="info">Starvation reduces happiness proportional to the city population.</span>

* **Immigration**.

* **The Void**.
